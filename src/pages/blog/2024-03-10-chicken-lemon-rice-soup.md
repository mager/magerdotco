<h4>Ingredients:</h4>

<ul>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">1 medium sweet onion</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">2-3 carrots</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">5-6 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">½ cup fresh parsley, or a handful</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">64 oz. low sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">¾ cup jasmine rice, rinsed until clear water flows through</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">1-2 lemons, yeilding ½ cup lemon juice</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">1 can coconut cream (or coconut milk)</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">Olive oil, butter, garlic powder, salt, and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Optionally, you can substitute the following to make a Mexican-themed version:</p>

<ul>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">Lime instead of lemon</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">Assorted mini sweet peppers instead of carrots</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">Add sweet corn and green chilies</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions:</h4>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Rinse and pick the parsley and let it dry for chopping later. Dice the onion and cut the carrots into bite-sized pieces. Grate the garlic and set aside. </p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Bring a large dutch oven over medium high heat and add a pad of butter, a glug of olive oil, and the chopped onions. Salt, pepper, garlic powder and carmelize these onions for 5-7 minutes.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Once the onions have softened up add the garlic and carrots and saute for 2-3 more minutes. Then add the rice and go for 2-3 more minutes. It's okay to toast the rice a little.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Add the chicken and broth and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover for 20 minutes. During this time, the rice will thicken up and the chicken will cook.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Remove the chicken from the pot and shred with two forks. Add it back to the pot with the coconut cream.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Chop the parsley and add the lemon and cook on low for as long as you want, or serve immediately. You can also add some coconut cream to thicken it up even more.</p>
