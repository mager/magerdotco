<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Bring a large dutch oven over medium high heat and add a pad of butter, a glug of olive oil, and the chopped onions. Salt, pepper, and carmelize these onions for 2-3 minutes, then add the chopped garlic.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Saute for 2-3 more minutes until things soften up then add the carrots and rice and go for 2-3 more minutes. It's okay to toast the rice a little.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Add the chicken and broth and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover for 20 minutes. During this time, the rice will thicken up and the chicken will cook.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Remove the chicken from the pot and shred with two forks. Add it back to the pot.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Chop the parsley and add the lemon and cook on low for as long as you want, or serve immediately. You can also add some coconut cream to thicken it up even more.</p>
