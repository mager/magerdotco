<h4>Ingredients:</h4>

<ul>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">6 garlic cloves, diced</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">2 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">3 medium shallots</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">2½ cups heavy cream</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">1 Tbsp. thyme leaves, plus more for garnish</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">4 lb. russet potatoes, scrubbed, very thinly sliced on a mandoline</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">3 oz. Gruyère, finely grated</li>
    <li itemProp="recipeIngredient">1 oz. Parmesan, finely grated</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions:</h4>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Preheat oven to 325°. Rub butter all over inside of a cassarole dish.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Dice the shallots and saute with 1 tbsp of butter and olive oil. Add the diced garlic after 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper. Now add thyme leaves and toss around for 1 minute.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">In a medium saucepan, add the heavy cream and the shallot mixture and bring it up to a simmer over low heat. Cook until shallots and garlic are very soft, about 15 minutes. Let cool slightly. Optionally transfer to a blender and blend until smooth.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Scrub the potatos and strip with a peeler. Then start thinly slicing them on a mandoline. In the dish, start fanning out a handful at a time and placing the potato slices at an angle to ensures every scoop will have tender potatoes from the bottom and crispy edges from the top.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Shingle all the sliced potatoes until the bottom of dish is covered. Tuck smaller slices into any gaps to fill. Pour cream mixture over potatoes and cover dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake potatoes until tender and creamy, 65–70 minutes. Let cool.</p>

<p itemProp="recipeInstruction">Place rack in highest position; heat broiler. Remove foil and top potatoes with 3 oz. Gruyère, finely grated, and 1 oz. Parmesan, finely grated. Broil until cheese is bubbling and top of gratin is golden brown, 5–10 minutes. Serve topped with more thyme leaves.</p>
