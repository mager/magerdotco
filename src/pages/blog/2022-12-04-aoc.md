_This post is still a work in progress, please excuse the incompleteness_

The excitement of waking up every morning with a new puzzle to solve is one of the many reasons I love December. I've never actually completed [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), a daily advent calendar-style programming challenge created by [@ericwastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl), but I think this is my year.

I've made attempts in the past, but usually gave up because it was too hard, or I didn't have time to go all the way through 31 different challenges. But this year, I figured out a way to make it easier, and I decided to learn 31 new programming languages in the process.

## [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1): Javascript

My original plan was to actually complete all of the challenges in Golang first, and then I was going to attempt to [learn Rust](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/rust/) and do each challenge in Rust. This turned out to be a lot more work than I thought; it tooks significantly more code to solve the challenges in Golang & Rust and I wanted to have success faster.

Enter our trusty, old friend from long ago: Javascript.

I started the challenge a few days late (December 3rd), so I wanted to lurk on Github and see how others were solving the puzzles. Some would call this cheating; I call it learning. I had an ephiphany when I was saw how simple [@colourgarden's JS solution for Day 1](https://github.com/colourgarden/advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/day1/index.js) was:

```js
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

// Get input data of groups of numbers separated by blank lines.
const data = fs.readFileSync(`./input.txt`, 'utf-8');

// Convert the individual lines of each group to Numbers and tally.
const elves = data.split('\n\n').map(group => {
  return group
    .split('\n')
    .map(group => Number(group))
    .reduce((total, calories) => total + calories);
});

// Find the biggest number in the resultant array.
const most = Math.max(...elves);

// Get the index of the biggest number.
const who = elves.indexOf(most);

// Print answer to part one.
console.log(`Elf ${who} is carrying the most calories. They are carrying ${most} calories.`);
```

This code is concise, well-commented, and super easy to understand. I ran it locally and got the answer for part 1. His solution for part 2 was just as nice:

```js
// Sort values by descending.
const sorted = [...elves].sort((a, b) => b - a);

// Get three biggest numbers and tally.
const topThree = sorted.slice(0, 3).reduce((total, calories) => total + calories);

// Print answer to part two.
console.log(topThree);
```

I peeked at his solution for day 2 and did the same thing. He hadn't started the challenge for day 3 yet but I was determined to solve it. With a little help from [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), I was able to solve day 3! 

**I had my new plan: each day, complete all of the challenges in Javascript first, then try to complete the challenge in a new language I'm not familiar with.**

## [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2): Rust

When I initially attempted the challenge in Rust, I set out to find some solutions from skilled Rust developers on Github. Luckily, I found [this awesome repo](https://github.com/Bogdanp/awesome-advent-of-code) with AOC solutions in many languages. I jumped the Rust section and tried to find a good example.
