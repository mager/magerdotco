This is one of those stuffing recipies that you can take your time to prep. Chop veggies ahead of time so the actual act of making it is easier.

Thanksgiving simply isn't complete without a good stuffing, and this recipe will raise the bar on how you think about stuffing going forward. We'll borrow most of it from [Bon Appetit's "If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It" recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it-stuffing) from Chris Morroco in 2017.

We've been making this stuffing for the past 4 years and so good that it's hard to try anything else. This recipe goes perfectly with my [Thankgiving Turkey](/blog/2020-11-25-thanksgiving-turkey) recipe, but it could be made year-round.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more
- 1 loaf sourdough bread (1 ½lb), sliced 1 inch thick, torn into ½ inch pieces
- 1 pound breakfast sausage (or 1/2 cup green lentils)
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 shallots, finely chopped
- 1 fennel bulb, finely chopped
- 4 cloves of garlic, minched
- 2 stalks of leeks (or celery)
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Diamond Crystal (or other Kosher) salt
- Ground black pepper
- 1 cup dry white wine
- ¼ cup finely chopped parsley
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped sage
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped thyme
- 3 eggs
- 4 cups chicken stock (or veggie stock)

### Instructions

You should plan to gather all of the above ingredients before getting started. Finely chop the onion, shallots, fennel, and leeks and set aside. The leeks can be put into a bowl with cold water to clean them properly. Mince the garlic and chop up the fragrant herbs.

Preheat the oven to 300º and then tear up the bread into bite-sized pieces. Dry out the bread in the oven for about 15-20 minutes until it's a little softer than a crouton; crispy but chewy. Toss the bread into a big bowl and set aside.

Cook the sausage and set aside.

Put all that butter into a skillet and melt it. Throw in the mirepoix (onion, shallots, fennel, leeks, garlic) with salt and pepper and sauté until it's soft, about 10-15 minutes. Toss in the fragrant herbs (parsley, sage, thyme) for a minute or two then pour the carmelized mix into the bread bowl. Pour in the wine and sweat it out for 5 more minutes.

Whisk the eggs in a bowl with half the stock (2 cups) stock and then pour that in the bowl. Add the sausage and then mix it all together.

Butter a 9x13-inch baking pan then pour in the bread mixture, evening it out. Pour some more stock on top (1-2 cups); don't worry, the bread will soak it up and the oven will dry it out. Cover with aluminum foil.

Crank up the oven to 400º convection and put the stuffing in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, take a whiff, and cook for another 35-45 minutes. At this point, the top should be crusty but the bottom should still be soft.

Let it rest for 15 minutes, and then serve. Top it with gravy for an enhanced experience.
