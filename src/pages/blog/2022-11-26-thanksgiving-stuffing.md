Thanksgiving simply isn't complete without a good stuffing, and this recipe will raise the bar on how you think about stuffing going forward. We'll borrow most of it from [Bon Appetit's "If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It" recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it-stuffing) from Chris Morroco in 2017.

We've been making this stuffing for the past 4 years and so good that it's hard to try anything else. This recipe goes perfectly with my [Thankgiving Turkey](/blog/2020-11-25-thanksgiving-turkey) recipe, but it could be made year-round.

### Ingredients

* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more
* 1 loaf sourdough bread, sliced 1 inch thick, torn into ½ inch pieces
* 1 pound breakfast sausage (or 1/2 cup green lentils)
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 1 fennel bulb, finely chopped
* 2 stalks of leeks (or celery)
* Extra-virgin olive oil
* Diamond Crystal (or other Kosher) salt
* Ground black pepper
* ½ cup dry white wine
* ¼ cup finely chopped parsley
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped sage
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped thyme
* 3 eggs
