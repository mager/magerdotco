_This post is a work in progress. I'll finish it soon._

Whenever I reunite with an old friend from years past, the conversaion always naturally flows into questions about what we're watching and listening to.

When it's time to part ways, I usually say that I'll send them a list of my favorite podcasts that they msut listen to, but I never get around to it. This year I'm just going to publish my list here and link my friends to it.

My podcast library has drastically changed over the years.
