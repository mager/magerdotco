## [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10): Clojure

I'm ashamed to say I've never really used emacs or learned Lisp. I was exposed to vim once I entered the real world after college, and have since upgraded to VSCode. I heard of Lisp first from a good friend who went to MIT to study computer science, but I always shied aeway from it because of the syntax.

Our favorite website for learning new languages, [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elisp/), has a great introduction to using Emacs Lisp.

I also learned from ChatGPT what `car` and `cdr` mean:

I found an awesome solution from [@coutego](https://github.com/coutego/advent-of-code-2022/blob/main/src/aoc22.el).
