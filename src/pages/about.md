Hey there, I'm Mager! I'm an engineering manager at Uber, where I spend my weekdays building delivery APIs. On the weekends, you'll usually find me writing some code, exploring new restaurants with my wife and our dog, and enjoying a cold beer (I love keeping track of my favorite brews on [Untappd](https://untappd.com/user/mager)).

I'm also a proud Chicagoan and love to explore the vibrant neighborhoods and hidden gems of this amazing city.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about all things code, food, sports, and beer, don't hesitate to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mager)! Looking forward to hearing from you.
